        # 🚀 Get started here

        This template guides you through CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), variables, and tests.

        ## 🔖 **How to use this template**

        #### **Step 1: Send requests**

        RESTful APIs allow you to perform CRUD operations using the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.

        This collection contains each of these [request](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/) types. Open each request and click "Send" to see what happens.

        #### **Step 2: View responses**

        Observe the response tab for status code (200 OK), response time, and size.

        #### **Step 3: Send new Body data**

        Update or add new data in "Body" in the POST request. Typically, Body data is also used in PUT request.

        ```
        {
            "name": "Add your name in the body"
        }

         ```

        #### **Step 4: Update the variable**

        Variables enable you to store and reuse values in Postman. We have created a [variable](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) called `base_url` with the sample request [https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me](https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me). Replace it with your API endpoint to customize this collection.

        #### **Step 5: Add tests in the "Scripts" tab**

        Adding tests to your requests can help you confirm that your API is working as expected. You can write test scripts in JavaScript and view the output in the "Test Results" tab.

        ## 💪 Pro tips

        - Use folders to group related requests and organize the collection.
            
        - Add more [scripts](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/intro-to-scripts/) to verify if the API works as expected and execute workflows.

                This is a PUT request and it is used to overwrite an existing
                piece of data. For instance, after you create an entity with a
                POST request, you may want to modify that later. You can do that
                using a PUT request. You typically identify the entity being
                updated by including an identifier in the URL (eg. `id=1`).


                A successful PUT request typically returns a `200 OK`, `201

                This is a GET request and it is used to "get" data from an
                endpoint. There is no request body for a GET request, but you
                can use query parameters to help specify the resource you want
                data on (e.g., in this request, we have `id=1`).


                A successful GET response will have a `200 OK` status, and
                should include some kind of response body - for example, HTML
                web content or JSON data.

                This is a DELETE request, and it is used to delete data that was
                previously created via a POST request. You typically identify

                (eg. `id=1`).


                A successful DELETE request typically returns a `200 OK`, `202
